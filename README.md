# EduRater: Rate My Educator
> Parents, students, educators, and the community always want to be informed about the staff working at elementary and high schools.  This app, EduRater, is used to rate teachers and principals.  Parents/Guardians and students can find their future teachers and principals, the community can find information about the schools in the area, and other educators can use this to find out about the work environment of their prospective teaching postions.
> Live demo [_here_](https://damp-wildwood-31060-690d212e58d9.herokuapp.com/). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->

## General Information
Do you want to give a shout out to a special teacher?  Do you have a horrible principal who should not be leading the school?  Or are you looking for a job as a teacher and wondering what the school environment is like?  No matter what your situation is, EduRATEr is the place for other teachers, administrators, parents, students, and the community to rate an educator and leave honest reviews.  Give a 1-5 star rating on an educator, leave your review, and also give stars to other users’ ratings.  Elementary and high school students are our future and these bright young minds are in the hands of teachers and principals. Team Mann wanted to create a place to find out the truth of who our children are being led by. This app was built using REACT, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM. Our app is deployed on Heroku and is responsive so users can use it on the go.
